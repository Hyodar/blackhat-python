# blackhat-python
Hacking/Pentesting tools made by following the book Black Hat Python, as well as some other security projects

My versions are quite different from the ones in the book, mainly because of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax and overall functionalities.
The `extra` folder contains some other projects of mine not necessarily based on the book
